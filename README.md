# WNBA Lists

- I have a Twitter bot called [@WNBAWeNeedFic](https://twitter.com/WNBAWeNeedFic).
- As a result of creating this bot, I have some alphabetical lists of WNBA players, coaches, and teams that other people could theoretically use.
- Here they are.
- World's largest shoutout to [Across the Timeline](https://acrossthetimeline.com/wnba/transactions.html#trteam=All%20Players&view=tracker) for player signing status data used to populate [wnba-players.txt](https://github.com/cms0008/WNBA-Lists/blob/main/wnba-players.txt) during free agency.

_Disclaimer: WNBA free agency is underway for 2024! The list of players will be updated semi-regularly and may not be correct until rosters are finalized around the first day of games (May 14)._
