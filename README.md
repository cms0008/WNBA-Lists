# WNBA Lists

- I have a Twitter bot called [@WNBAWeNeedFic](https://twitter.com/WNBAWeNeedFic).
- As a result of creating this bot, I have some alphabetical lists of WNBA players, coaches, and teams that other people could theoretically use.
- Here they are (in .txt and .json formats!).
- World's largest shoutout to [Across the Timeline](https://acrossthetimeline.com/wnba/transactions.html#trteam=All%20Players) for player signing status data used to populate [wnba-players.txt](https://github.com/cms0008/WNBA-Lists/blob/main/wnba-players.txt) throughout free agency.
